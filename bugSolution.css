The corrected CSS code snippet is:
```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  /* Correct: Spaces added around the minus operator */
  border: 10px solid black;
}
```
By adding spaces around the `-` operator, we ensure that the `calc()` function interprets the expression correctly, leading to the expected width calculation across different browsers.  It is important to always follow the correct syntax for `calc()`, including spaces around all operators (+, -, *, /). Also consider using parenthesis for complex calculations.
